2048 is played on a plain 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. 
The game begins with two tiles already in the grid, having a value of either 2 or 4, and another such tile appears in a random empty space after each turn.
The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
